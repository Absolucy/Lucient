Introducing **Lucient**, a wonderful lockscreen overhaul for iOS, inspired by the Android 12 beta!

# Customization

Lucient is fully customizable! You can switch the font between an iOS style, Android 12 style, or bring your own font.
The text can be recolored to whatever you want, or can automatically adjust to fit whatever wallpaper you have!
Even little details, such as spacing, can be adjusted to fit whatever you visualize.

# Sharing

Want to share your setup with others? Don't worry, you can easily export your setup and share it with others!
No need to struggle to copy ten bajillion character gibberish, instead we can automatically export to and import it from a pastebin link!
