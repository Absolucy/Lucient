Introducing **Lucient**, a wonderful lockscreen overhaul for iOS, inspired by the Android 12 beta!

## Customization

Lucient is fully customizable! You can switch the font between an iOS style, Android 12 style, or bring your own font.
The text can be recolored to whatever you want, or can automatically adjust to fit whatever wallpaper you have!
Even little details, such as spacing, can be adjusted to fit whatever you visualize.

## Sharing

Want to share your setup with others? Don't worry, you can easily export your setup and share it with others!
No need to struggle to copy ten bajillion character gibberish, instead we can automatically export to and import it from a pastebin link!

## Support

Email <support@absolucy.moe> for support. Do not be vague — describe your issue as specifically as possible, including any relevant information, such as crash logs or screenshots relating to the issue. ***It is fully expected that you have basic technical knowledge, such as how to get a crash log, as anyone jailbreaking their devices should.***

If the issue is relating to product activation, then **you must include some proof of purchase with your email**. Both Chariz and Paypal will email you a receipt whenever purchasing Lucient, which serves as a sufficient proof of purchase.

## Return Policy

Lucient has a [free trial](https://chariz.com/get/lucient-trial), and it is recommended that you take advantage of that in order to ensure that it works properly on your device, and that you will enjoy using it.

However, if you change your mind within a short amount of time (within 1-2 days of original purchase), it is likely that I will be willing to issue a refund anyways.

As Lucient does not guarantee compatibility with other tweaks or software, refunds will not be issued due to incompatibilities with tweaks or software that are not *explicitly* supported (testing does not mean explicit support, it is only done for convienence purposes).

Refund requests relating to issues **must** have relevant details about the issue attached — crash logs, screenshots, a description of the issue, and/or how to reproduce the issue. If the attached details are too vague, additional details may be requested.

Refund requests which are rude or impolite may be rejected without further explaination.

Any refund requests must be sent to <support@absolucy.moe>, with either your Chariz purchase reference or PayPal transaction ID.
